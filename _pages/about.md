Currently I'm a data scientist at Sony Music Entertainment. I am focusing on buildng product feature, testing and improving the user experience with experimental design and hypothesis testing. At the same time, I also worked on several ad hoc projects, for example, making strategies for artist promotion and building machine learning model to predict market share.
